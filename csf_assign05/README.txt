Eventually your report about how you implemented thread synchronization
in the server should go here

In the server we made there are critical sections that should happen anywhere threads access a shared state such as room map (m_rooms) or even the membership lists inside each room. The sections I'm talking about can include creating/finding rooms, adding/removing users, and even broadcasting some messages. This is because of how multiple threads can perform these such operations I listed at the same time. I identified them by checking where concurent reads/writes to the shared data may be leads to inconsistent state. In order to protect these areas, we used a single pthread_mutex_t (m_lock) around each critical section. By using one lock its helping keep everything regarding the design simple and deadlocks would be avoided because there isn't code that tries acquiring multiple locks. There isn't blocking IO happening while holding the mutex and the user message queues can already be seen to be synchronized. Therefore, this server is kept safe without any additional unecessary locking. Therefore overall, these synchronization choices should make sure there is correect behavior regarding concurrency without having synchronization hazards.
